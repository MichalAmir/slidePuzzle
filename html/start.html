       <h2>A bit about the game</h2>
       <p> Play the classic Game of 15 tile slide puzzle game with this online 15-puzzle app. Slide your tiles around the game board until you have arranged them in the correct order. As positions are moved into the correct positions, they will turn green. Just Click or Tap the puzzle piece you want to move to slide it to the empty space beside it. You can also click a tile horizontally or vertically multiple pieces away from the empty space to move the full column or row. Turn the timer on or off for either a competitive or casual experience when playing this slide puzzle game. Relax while playing the game or get your adrenaline rushing as you compete for a new high score.
        
        When you click start, the game will take a few seconds to shuffle the tiles. It's important you see the tiles in the correct order and then how they are shuffled (as if on an actual table without lifting the pieces) so you know that the game board hasn't been randomized into an impossible-to-solve combination.
