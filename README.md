## 🧠 Project Description

**Slide Puzzle** is a browser-based logic game built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It challenges the user to restore a shuffled image by sliding tiles into their correct positions.

The project focuses on:
⚙️ **DOM manipulation** — selecting and updating tile elements in real-time
🧠 **Game logic** — allowing only valid moves (adjacent tiles) and detecting when the puzzle is solved
📱 **Responsive layout** — works on both desktop and mobile
💡 **No frameworks** — written in clean, modular JavaScript

> This project demonstrates a strong grasp of DOM APIs, event-driven architecture, and JavaScript logic — wrapped in a functional, minimal UI.
